This repository contains original and gated single-cell data used to generate figures in the manuscript entitled "Multiplex single-cell tracing across time and division states enables control of T-cell differentiation".

Included here: FCS files for mass cytometry data and a CSV file for processed single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Raw single-cell RNA-sequencing data and metadata are available on Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; GEO accession number: GSE119139).

An extended version of the Java-based Vortex software and documentation can be accessed at: https://github.com/nolanlab/vortex.
