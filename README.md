This repository contains original and gated single-cell data used to generate figures in the manuscript entitled "Proliferative tracing with single-cell mass cytometry optimizes generation of stem cell memory-like T cells".

Included here: FCS files for mass cytometry data and a CSV file for processed single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Raw single-cell RNA-sequencing data and metadata are available on Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; GEO accession number: GSE119139).

In the final version of the manuscript, Figures 1 and 2 were combined (new Figure 1), Figure 3 was kept (new Figure 2), Figures 4 and 5 were combined (new Figure 3), and Figure 6 was kept (new Figure 4). With questions, please reach out to zinaida@stanford.edu or bendall@stanford.edu.
